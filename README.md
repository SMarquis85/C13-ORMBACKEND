  ## Description of Assignment

Internet retail, also known as e-commerce, is the largest sector of the electronics industry, having generated an estimated US$29 trillion in 2017 (Source: United Nations Conference on Trade and Development). E-commerce platforms like Shopify and WooCommerce provide a suite of services to businesses of all sizes. Due to the prevalence of these platforms, developers should understand the fundamental architecture of e-commerce sites.

Your challenge is to build the back end for an e-commerce site. Youâ€™ll take a working Express.js API and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

  ## About

### User Story

```

SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies

```
### Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia Core for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON

  ## Final Work Review

**"Always leave the code a little cleaner than when you found it."**  This action was applied to ALL JAVASCRIPT files. To create this assignment, I used Lawrence Wilson's Audiobook, Cathy Tanimura's book on SQL. References we're found on Google, multiple websites including W3Schools, DEV, GitHub, Insomnia and Tutorialspoint. YouTube was helpful as well as all ZOOM recordings (of previous classes). Looks much cleaner, organised and easier to find what you are looking for. I also received the help of my second tutor, Erik Hoversten. He helped clean up my code, demonstrate how to use Insomnia and fix multiple errors I have encountered while building this database.
